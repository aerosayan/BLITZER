# BLITZER
A competetive progamming library. Created, since in competitions I would like to focus on the problems and not spend time in creating standard data structures and algorithms. </br>

Lol! This is Kimberly "Sweet Brown" Wilkins, we love her.

### Modules created for Python27:
#### Started creation on : 28/JUNE/2018
+ Single linked list module, has the following features
  + store head, tail and size as data members
  + update tail node iteratively and track it when appending new nodes
  + prepend new nodes to the link list
  + insert node after some given node
  + append new nodes to the link list
  + delete node with the given data key
  + delete the full linked list
  + get size of the linked list in O(1) or worst case in O(n)
  + track size of the linked list when adding or deleting nodes to allow  O(1) complexity to get size
  + search for a node matching with given data key
  + go to nth position and get the node
  + go to nth node from last and get the node
  + Floyd's cycle finding algorithm to detect loops
  + get loop size if a loop is present
  + reverse the full linked list in place
  + only print the linked list in reverse using recursion for now
  + swap two nodes of given data keys
  + swap the head and tail of the linked list
  + join two different linked lists
  + detect if two linked lists are identical
